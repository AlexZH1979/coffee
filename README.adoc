= Enterprise Coffee

The example project of my _Facing the Challenges of Microservice Development in the Cloud_ webinar.

Comprises two applications, _coffee-shop_ and _barista_, which can be deployed locally, or to a Kubernetes and Istio cluster.

== Local Docker

In order to run the Docker containers locally, execute `./docker-run-local.sh`.
As a prerequisite, you need to create a Docker network first: + 
`docker network create --subnet=192.168.42.0/24 dkrnet`

== Istio

Uses the Istio v1alpha3 networking API and requires Istio version â‰¥ `1.0`.

= Enterprise Coffee

The example project of my _12-factor, Cloud Native Enterprise Java Applications_ presentation.

Comprises two applications, _coffee-shop_ and _barista_, which can be deployed locally, or to a Kubernetes and Istio cluster.

Uses the Istio v1alpha3 networking API and requires Istio version â‰¥ `1.0`.

            • Transparently add technical cross-cutting concerns to microservices
            • Think “AOP for applications”
            • Routing, load-balancing, resiliency, telemetry, auth
            • Integrates well with Java Enterprise approach:
              • Business logic is a responsibility of the applications
              • Technical concerns are part of the environment

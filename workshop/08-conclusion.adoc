== Conclusion

TODO

- benefits of cloud native technology

- service meshes
  - adding required cross-cutting concerns in a transparent way
  - improving testability of applications (orchestration, service-lookup, fault-injection)

Similarly, as an outlook, you could perform the steps of introducing a new subset, gradually switching the traffic in the routing rules until all traffic is routed to the new version as automated steps that are part of a deployment pipeline. TODO refer to some example or documentation

== Observability with Istio

The fact that the sidecar proxy containers intercept all traffic enables them to inspect the information and attributes of HTTP connections.
Istio adds observability to our microservices via this technique without requiring us to change the applications.
It ships with monitoring, service graph dependency information, logging, and distributed tracing out of the box.

TODO

- monitoring
  - show default Grafana, technical related metrics

- service graph (Kiali)

- tracing, explain MicroProfile OpenTracing
  esp. with Open Liberty
  Jaeger
